========

A Beeswarm plot is a two-dimensional visualisation technique where data points are plotted relative to a fixed reference axis so that no two datapoints overlap. The beeswarm plot is a useful technique when we wish to see not only the measured values of interest for each data point, but also the distribution of these values. In this project, we implement a Beeswarm plot in Javascript.
